## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to perform mileage prediction using regression analysis. Regression analysis is a statistical modeling technique that estimates the relationship between mileage and other variables. By analyzing the dataset and building a regression model, this project aims to predict the mileage of cars based on different predictor variables.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is sourced from StatLibrary, which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. It contains information about various variables related to cars, including mileage, engine size, weight, horsepower, and more. The dataset is crucial for performing regression analysis and predicting mileage accurately.
